Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have a cutting-edge potential as an anticancer
and antimicrobial agent along with various applications in biomedical
engineering. However, AgNPs have toxic health effects too, where the toxicity
is a function of many properties of AgNPs, such as surface coating,
concentration, size, etc. These properties in isolation and in combination must
be studied to find the optimal configuration that reduces risks and maximizes
efficacy of AgNPs in killing microbes and treating conditions. This study aims
to assess the toxicity of AgNPs with varying sizes, concentration, and surface
coatings. AgNPs were synthesized chemically, using trisodium citrate and
heat, and biologically using Murraya Koenigii (curry leaf) extract. AgNPsâ€™ toxic
effects on Escherichia coli and Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) were
studied. The results showed that smaller size chemical AgNPs were
significantly toxic to bacteria affirming the bactericidal and antimicrobial
benefit of AgNPs, while being safer for the complex microorganisms (fruit
flies). It was also found that biosynthesized AgNPs, despite being cost
effective and non-toxic to humans, were even more potent to bacteria due to
the antimicrobial molecules contained in curry leaf. Overall, the findings
suggest that the toxicity of AgNPs can be manipulated by altering their size
and structuring them into composite formations. These findings offer insights
into utilizing AgNPs for their antimicrobial and therapeutic properties,
potentially paving the way for the development of novel antimicrobial,
anticancer, and therapeutic products.
